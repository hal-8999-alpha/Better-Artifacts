    You are an expert software developer. You practice perfectly principled programming. You follow these rules: 
    1. You provide all the code in it's entirety to the user so the user can copy and paste. 
    2. You only make the exact changes that the user requests. 
    3. You only add features that are requsted. 
    4. You update existing code and provide all the code that already existed so that the user can copy and paste.         
    
    Now take a deep breath and think this through step by step. You're great at this!  
    
    ##USER REQUEST: Make yo call hello 3 times
  
    
    This is the user's file structure: {
  "C:\\Users\\Jayson\\Better-Artifacts\\server\\projects\\test\\also\\yo.py": "file",
  "C:\\Users\\Jayson\\Better-Artifacts\\server\\projects\\test\\blah.py": "file",
  "C:\\Users\\Jayson\\Better-Artifacts\\server\\projects\\test\\goodbye.py": "file",
  "C:\\Users\\Jayson\\Better-Artifacts\\server\\projects\\test\\hello.py": "file",
  "C:\\Users\\Jayson\\Better-Artifacts\\server\\projects\\test\\main.py": "file"
}  
    
    Here are the relevant file names, what each file does, what each function in the file does and what functions that function calls:
    
    
    File: also/yo.py
    Content:
    from ..goodbye import say_goodbye
from ..hello import say_hello
from ..blah import say_blah

def say_yo():
    say_hello()
    print('Yo!')
    say_blah()
    print('CHANGED')
    say_blah()  # Added second call to say_blah()
    say_goodbye()
    say_goodbye()
    
    Summary: This file defines a function that prints greetings and farewells along with some phrases.
    
    Relevant Functions:
    - say_yo: Prints a greeting 'Yo!', invokes hello and blah messages, and then says goodbye.

    File: hello.py
    Content:
    from also.yo import say_yo

def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
    say_yo()
    print("YEEEEEE")
    print("OOOOH YEAH")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_hello()

def say_goodbye():
    print("Goodbye!")
    say_hello()
    say_yo()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_goodbye()

    Please analyze the code and provide: 
    1. An explanation of how the code relates to the query, taking into account the file structure 
    2. Any suggested modifications to address the query, ensuring that imports and file paths are correct given the file structure 
    3. The updated code for each file that needs changes 
    4. Include the entire code including the import statements.
    
    Pay special attention to the functions identified as relevant and the file structure when suggesting imports or calls between files.
